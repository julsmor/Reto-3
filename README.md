**Ejercicio, clase 7**
Cree la clase Rectangle.
The rectangle should be inicialice using any of these 3 methods:

Method 1: Bottom-left corner(Point) + width and height
Method 2: Center(Point) + width and height
Method 3: Two opposite corners (Points) e.g. Bottom-left and Upper-right
width, height, center: Instance attributes

compute_area(): should return the area of the rectangle

compute_perimeter(): should return the perimeter of the rectangle

Create a class Square() that inherited the required attributes and methods from Rectangle.

Create a method called compute_interference_point(Point) that returns if a point is inside or a rectangle.
